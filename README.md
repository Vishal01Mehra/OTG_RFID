This repository provides code and hardware documentation for interfacing the **MFRC522 RFID reader** with an **STM32G0 series microcontroller** over SPI. The firmware initializes the MFRC522, detects RFID cards, and prints their UID over UART. It also includes support for an **addressable RGB LED** (e.g., WS2812B) and a **buzzer** for feedback.

##  Features
- Uses STM32Cube HAL for SPI, GPIO, and TIM
- Reads MIFARE cards (UID output)
- Controls an addressable RGB LED (PA3)
- Activates buzzer on card detection (PA2)
- Compatible with MFRC522 13.56 MHz modules
- Designed for STM32G0xx (e.g., STM32G071, STM32G031)
- Antenna is tuned for best theoretical range (10â€“15â€¯cm)

>  **Note:** Higher read ranges (>15â€¯cm) are only possible with UHF RFID chipsets (e.g., EPC Gen2, ISO18000-6C), which are significantly more expensive. This project limits itself to a 13.56â€¯MHz MFRC522-based design due to a target **cost constraint of â‚¹500**, making UHF solutions out of scope.
